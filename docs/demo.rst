Structure and contents of parser's result are hard to desribe in simple words.
That's why project's demo page was created.

Demo address: http://il2fb-mission-parser-demo.herokuapp.com

You can use the demo to check whether the parser can process some mission file.
Also the demo gives you ability to see the result of parsing in "raw" format
(``Raw output`` tab). You can use understandable and pretty format either
(``Mission details`` tab).

Bug reports are created and reported automatically if some errors occur.
Reports contain an error message and a link to the mission which caused the
error. You can `see current open issues here <https://github.com/IL2HorusTeam/il2fb-mission-parser/issues>`_.
