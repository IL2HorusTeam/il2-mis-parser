This chapter describes output formats for section parsers. Datailed description
of input data aslo included.

.. note::

    Format of mission files can be very tricky in some sections and original
    key names may be misleading. We made our best to adopt strange things
    for normal humans, but some questions still may appear in your mind.
    Get ready!

.. note::
