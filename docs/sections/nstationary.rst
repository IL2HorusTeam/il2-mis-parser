NStationary section
===================

.. note::

    `Russian version <https://github.com/IL2HorusTeam/il2fb-mission-parser/wiki/%D0%A1%D0%B5%D0%BA%D1%86%D0%B8%D1%8F-NStationary>`_

:class:`~il2fb.parsers.mission.sections.nstationary.NStationarySectionParser`
is responsible for parsing ``NStationary`` section. Each line of this section
describes a single stationary object (except buildings and houses).

Section example::

The output of the parser is a dictionary with  ``stationary`` item which
contains a list of stationary objects.

Set of parameters may differ for different `types of units`_:

#. all objects have at least 7 parameters;
#. artillery has 3 own extra parameters;
#. aircrafts have 5 own extra parameters;
#. ships have 3 own extra parameters.

Let's examine all of them:

Usual objects
-------------

Usual objects â€” these are all objects which have usual set of parameters,
namely: ballons, lights, radio stations, trains, vehicles and so on.

We use :class:`~il2fb.parsers.mission.sections.nstationary.StationaryObject`
data structure to store information about such objects.

Definition example::

  0_Static vehicles.stationary.Stationary$Wagon1 1 152292.72 89662.80 360.00 0.0

``0_Static``
  Object ID which is given by full mission editor. Contains ``Static`` word
  prefixed by a sequence number.

  :Output path: ``id``
  :Output type: :class:`str`
  :Output value: original string value

``vehicles.stationary.Stationary$Wagon1``
  Unit type (``stationary``) and code name (``Wagon1``).

  :Output path: ``type``
  :Output type: complex `unit type`_ constant

  ..

  :Output path: ``code``
  :Output type: :class:`str`
  :Output value: original string value

``1``
  Code number of army the object belongs to.

  :Output path: ``belligerent``
  :Output type: complex `belligerents`_ constant

``152292.72``
  X coordinate.

  :Output path: ``pos.x``
  :Output type: :class:`float`
  :Output value: original value converted to float number

``89662.80``
  Y coordinate.

  :Output path: ``pos.y``
  :Output type: :class:`float`
  :Output value: original value converted to float number

``360.00``
  Angle of rotation.

  :Output path: ``rotation_angle``
  :Output type: :class:`float`
  :Output value: original value converted to float number and taken modulo 360

``0.0``
  This parameter is not used by usual objects. It has a meaning only for
  artillery objects (see below).


Artillery
---------

Artillery has all the same parameters as usual objects. Also artillery in new
versions of game has some extra parameters which are described below.

We use :class:`~il2fb.parsers.mission.sections.nstationary.StationaryArtillery`
data structure to store information about artillery.

Definition example::

  1_Static vehicles.artillery.Artillery$SdKfz251 2 31333.62 90757.91 600.29 0.0 0 1 1

``0.0``
  Time of awakening (in minutes): it's a time which will pass since enemy unit
  enters object's range till object will react on that unit.

  :Output path: ``awakening_time``
  :Output type: :class:`float`
  :Output value:
    original value converted to float number
    (``0.0`` for objects from old game versions)

``0``
  Range of fire.

  :Output path: ``range``
  :Output type: :class:`int`
  :Output value:
    original value converted to integer number
    (``0`` for objects from old game versions)

``1``
  Skill level of gunners.

  :Output path: ``skill``
  :Output type:
    complex `skills`_ constant (``None`` for objects from old game versions)

``1``
  Tells whether to use spotter or not.

  :Output path: ``use_spotter``
  :Output type: :class:`bool`
  :Output value:
    ``True`` if ``1``, ``False`` otherwise
    (``False`` for objects from old game versions)


Aircrafts
---------

Aircrafts have all the same parameters as usual objects. Also aircrafts in new
versions of game have some extra parameters which are described below.

We use :class:`~il2fb.parsers.mission.sections.nstationary.StationaryAircraft`
data structure to store information about aircrafts.

Definition example::

  2_Static vehicles.planes.Plane$I_16TYPE24 2 134146.89 88005.43 336.92 0.0 de 2 1.0 I-16type24_G1_RoW3.bmp 1

``null``
  Code name of the air force. E.g., ``de`` or ``fr``. For some unknown reason
  air force of USSR has ``null`` code name in ``NStationary`` section.

  :Output path: ``air_force``
  :Output type: complex `air forces`_
  :Output value: constant (``None`` for objects from old game versions)

``2``
  Polysemantic parameter which can have next values:

  .. list-table::
     :widths: 20 80
     :header-rows: 1

     * - Value
       - Meaning
     * - 0
       - Usage of aircraft by humans is **not allowed**
     * - 1
       - Usage of aircraft by humans is **allowed**
     * - 2
       - Usage of aircraft by humans is **allowed**, object will be restored
         after successfull landing

  :Output path: ``allows_spawning``
  :Output type: :class:`bool`
  :Output value:
    ``True`` if ``1`` or ``2``, ``False`` otherwise
    (``False`` for objects from old game versions)

  ..

  :Output path: ``restorable``
  :Output type: :class:`bool`
  :Output value:
    ``True`` if ``2``, ``False`` otherwise
    (``False`` for objects from old game versions)

  Not used (not present in old game versions).

``I-16type24_G1_RoW3.bmp``
  Skin name.

  :Output path: ``skin``
  :Output type: :class:`str`
  :Output value:
    original string value or ``None`` if ``null``

  :Output type: :class:`bool`
  :Output value:
    ``True`` if ``1``, ``False`` otherwise
    (``None`` for objects from old game versions)


Ships
-----

Ships have all the same parameters as usual objects. Also ships in new versions
of game have some extra parameters which are described below.

structure to store information about ships.

Definition example::

  3_Static ships.Ship$G5 1 83759.05 115021.15 360.00 0.0 60 3 1.4

``60``
  Time of awakening (in minutes): it's a time which will pass since enemy unit
  enters ship's range till ship will react on that unit.

  :Output path: ``awakening_time``
  :Output type: :class:`float`
  :Output value:
    original value converted to float number
    (``0.0`` for objects from old game versions)

``3``
  Skill level of gunners.

  :Output path: ``skill``
  :Output type: complex `skills`_ constant
  :Output value: constant (``None`` for objects from old game versions)

``1.4``
  Recharge time (in minutes) of anti-aircraft guns of the ship.

  :Output path: ``recharge_time``
  :Output type: :class:`float`
  :Output value:
    original value converted to float number
    (``0.0`` for objects from old game versions)
