Introduction
============

**IL-2 Missions Parser** is a free Python library for parsing mission files
of IL-2 FB aviasim. It helps you to convert a text file in a tricky format into
a pretty Python object. If you are not familiar with missions, take a look at
`some of them <https://github.com/IL2HorusTeam/il2fb-mission-parser/tests/data>`_.
